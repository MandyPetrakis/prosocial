Prosocial is an big idea that I had to start somewhere. It was born from the desire to strengthen my relationships and become a better friend, partner, and professional by organizing contacts, taking notes on them, stroing important dates, and setting reminders to reach out. Currently however, it is an app that allows you to create contacts and add them to communities.

Dependencies include:

ruby-2.7.4
zustad 4.4.1
tailwinds 3.3.3
vite 4.4.9
react-router-dom 16.6
tastack.react-query 4.35.3

'npm run dev' will start the server.
